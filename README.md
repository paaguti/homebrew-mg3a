# homebrew-mg3a
My own tap for the mg3a editor

# History
I became aware of the mg3a editor a couple of years ago and got in contact with the author, Bengt Larsson. We started a very nice exchange, I suggested improvements and provided some patches. Then I started the integration with brew, which I have been maintaining for some time now.

Last news I have from Bengt are when he released version 170403. Since then, I have not been able to contact him again and his web site has been brought down. I have created a github with his original code and my improvements. The way I work is to keep the original code and use the quilt infrastructure available for Debian packages to introduce new features. I think is is the best way to keep the original code and introduce new features. It also integrated nicely with Homebrew.
